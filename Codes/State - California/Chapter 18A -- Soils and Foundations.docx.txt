The remainder of the shaft shall be permitted to be filled with controlled low-strength material (CLSM) when permitted by the construction documents. Excavation for lagging shall not be started until concrete has achieved sufficient strength for all anticipated loads as determined by the shoring design engineer.
Where boulders and/or cobbles have been identified in the geotechnical reports, contractor shall be prepared to address boulders and/or cobbles that may be encountered during the drilling of soldier piles and tie-back anchors.
The grouting equipment shall produce grout free of lumps and indispensed cement. The grouting equipment shall be sized to enable the grout to be pumped in continuous operation. The mixer shall be capable of continuously agitating the grout.
The quantity of grout and grout pressure shall be recorded. The grout pressure shall be controlled to prevent excessive heave in soils or fracturing rock formations.
If post-grouting is required, post-grouting operation shall be performed after initial grout has set for 24 hours in the bond length only. Tie-backs shall be grouted over a sufficient length (anchor bond length) to transfer the maximum anchor force to the anchor grout.
Testing of anchors in accordance with Section 1812A.4.1, Item 7 may be performed after post-grouting operations, provided grout has reached strength of 3,000 psi as required by PTI Recommendations for Prestressed Rock and Soil Anchors Section 6.11.
Anchor rods shall be tensioned straight and true. Excavation directly below the anchors shall not continue before those anchors are tested.
If a tie-back anchor initially fails the testing requirements, the anchor shall be permitted to be regrouted and retested. If anchor continues to fail, the followings steps shall be taken:
The contractor shall determine the cause of failure—variations of the soil conditions, installation methods, materials, etc.

The shoring design engineer shall be notified of any unusual conditions encountered during installation.
Calibration data for each test jack, pressure gauge and master pressure gauge shall be verified by the special inspector and geotechnical engineer. The calibration tests shall be performed by an independent testing laboratory and within 120 calendar days of the data submitted.
Monitoring points shall be established at the top and at the anchor heads of selected soldier piles and at intermediate intervals as considered appropriate by the geotechnical engineer.
Control points shall be established outside the area of influence of the shoring system to ensure the accuracy of the monitoring readings.
The periodic basis of shoring monitoring, as a minimum, shall be as follows:
Initial monitoring shall be performed prior to any excavation.
Once excavation has begun, the periodic readings shall be taken weekly until excavation reaches the estimated subgrade elevation and the permanent foundation is complete.
If performance of the shoring is within established guidelines, shoring design engineer may permit the periodic readings to be bi-weekly. Once initiated, bi-weekly readings shall continue until the building slab at ground floor level is completed and capable of transmitting lateral loads to the permanent structure. Thereafter, readings can be monthly.
Where the building has been designed to resist lateral earth pressures, the periodic monitoring of the soldier piles and adjacent structure can be discontinued once the ground floor diaphragm and subterranean portion of the structure is capable of resisting lateral soil loads and approved by the shoring design engineer, geotechnical engineer and building official.
Additional readings shall be taken when requested by the special inspector, shoring design engineer, geotechnical engineer or building official.
Monitoring reading shall be submitted to the shoring design engineer, engineer in responsible charge and building official within three working days after they are conducted. Monitoring readings shall be accurate to within 0.01 feet. Results are to be submitted in tabular form showing at least the initial date of monitoring and reading, current monitoring date and reading and difference between the two readings.
If the total cumulative horizontal or vertical movement (from start of construction) of the existing buildings reaches 1/2 inch or soldier piles reaches 1 inch all excavation activities shall be suspended. The geotechnical and shoring design engineer shall determine the cause of movement, if any, and recommend corrective measures, if necessary, before excavation continues.
If the total cumulative horizontal or vertical movement (from start of construction) of the existing buildings reaches 3/4 inch or soldier piles reaches 11/2 inches all excavation activities shall be suspended until the causes, if any, can be determined. Supplemental shoring shall be devised to eliminate further movement and the building official shall review and approve the supplemental shoring before excavation continues.
Monitoring of tie-back anchor loads:
Load cells shall be installed at the tie-back heads adjacent to buildings at maximum interval of 50 feet, with a minimum of one load cells per wall.
Load cell readings shall be taken once a day during excavation and once a week during the remainder of construction.
Load cell readings shall be submitted to the geotechnical engineer, shoring design engineer, engineer in responsible charge and building official.
Load cell readings can be terminated once the temporary shoring no longer provides support for the buildings.
1812A.7 Monitoring of Existing Structures

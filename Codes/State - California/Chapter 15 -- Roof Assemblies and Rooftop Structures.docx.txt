CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE — MATRIX ADOPTION TABLE
CHAPTER 15 — ROOF ASSEMBLIES AND ROOFTOP STRUCTURES
(Matrix Adoption Tables are nonregulatory, intended only as an aid to the code user.
See Chapter 1 for state agency authority and building applications.)
The state agency does not adopt sections identified by the following symbol: †
The Office of the State Fire Marshal's adoption of this chapter or individual sections is applicable to structures regulated by other state agencies pursuant to Section 1.11.
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 15 provides minimum requirements for the design and construction of roof assemblies and rooftop structures. The criteria address the weather-protective barrier at the roof and, in most circumstances, a fire-resistant barrier. The chapter is largely prescriptive in nature and is based on decades of experience with various traditional materials, but it also recognizes newer products. Section 1511 addresses rooftop structures, which include penthouses, tanks, towers and spires. Rooftop penthouses larger than prescribed in this chapter must be treated as a story under Chapter 5.
ICC code development note: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] or [P] will be considered by one of the code development committees meeting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.

It is permitted by the roof covering manufacturer and self-adhered underlayment manufacturer.
The existing sheathing is not water-soaked or deteriorated to the point that it is not adequate as a base for additional roofing.

1512.3 Roof Recover
The installation of a new roof covering over an existing roof covering shall be permitted where any of the following conditions occur:
Where the new roof covering is installed in accordance with the roof covering manufacturer's approved instructions.
Complete and separate roofing systems, such as standing-seam metal roof panel systems, that are designed to transmit the roof loads directly to the building's structural system and that do not rely on existing roofs and roof coverings for support, shall not require the removal of existing roof coverings.
Metal panel, metal shingle and concrete and clay tile roof coverings shall be permitted to be installed over existing wood shake roofs when applied in accordance with Section 1512.3.1.
The application of a new protective roof coating over an existing protective roof coating, metal roof panel, built-up roof, spray polyurethane foam roofing system, metal roof shingles, mineral-surfaced roll roofing, modified bitumen roofing or thermoset and thermoplastic single-ply roofing shall be permitted without tear off of existing roof coverings.
Exception: A roof recover shall not be permitted where any of the following conditions occur:
The existing roof or roof covering is water-soaked or has deteriorated to the point that the existing roof or roof covering is not adequate as a base for additional roofing.
The existing roof covering is slate, clay, cement or asbestos-cement tile.
The existing roof has two or more applications of any type of roof covering.
1512.3.1 Roof Recovering Over Wood Shingles or Shakes
Where the application of a new roof covering over wood shingle or shake roofs creates a combustible concealed space, the entire existing surface shall be covered with gypsum panel products, mineral fiber, glass fiber or other approved materials securely fastened in place.
1512.4 Reinstallation of Materials
Existing slate, clay or cement tile shall be permitted for reinstallation, except that damaged, cracked or broken slate or tile shall not be reinstalled.

CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE — MATRIX ADOPTION TABLE
CHAPTER 3 — OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION AND USE
(Matrix Adoption Tables are nonregulatory, intended only as an aid to the code user.
See Chapter 1 for state agency authority and building applications.)
The state agency does not adopt sections identified with the following symbol: †
The Office of the State Fire Marshal's adoption of this chapter or individual sections is applicable to structures regulated by other state agencies pursuant to Section 1.11.
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 3 provides the criteria by which buildings and structures are classified into use groups and occupancies. Through the balance of the code, occupancy classification is fundamental in the setting of features of construction; occupant safety requirements, especially building limitations; means of egress; fire protection systems; and interior finishes.
ICC code development note: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the IFC code development committee meeting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.
Section 301 Scope
301.1 General
The provisions of this chapter shall control the classification of all buildings and structures as to occupancy and use. Different classifications of occupancy and use represent varying levels of hazard and risk to building occupants and adjacent properties.
Section 302 Occupancy Classification and Use Designation
302.1 Occupancy Classification
Diagram
Occupancy classification is the formal designation of the primary purpose of the building, structure or portion thereof. Structures shall be classified into one or more of the occupancy groups specified in this section based on the nature of the hazards and risks to building occupants generally associated with the intended purpose of the building or structure. An area, room or space that is intended to be occupied at different times for different purposes shall comply with all applicable requirements associated with such potential multipurpose. Structures containing multiple occupancy groups shall comply with Section 508. Where a structure is proposed for a purpose that is not specified in this section, such structure shall be classified in the occupancy it most nearly resembles based on the fire safety and relative hazard. Occupiable roofs shall be classified in the group that the occupancy most nearly resembles, according to the fire safety and relative hazard, and shall comply with Section 503.1.4.
Assembly (see Section 303): Groups A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5.
Business (see Section 304): Group B.
[SFM] Organized Camps (see Section 450): Group C.
Educational (see Section 305): Group E.
Factory and Industrial (see Section 306): Groups F-1 and F-2.
High Hazard (see Section 307): Groups H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4 and H-5.
Institutional (see Section 308): Groups I-2, I-3 and I-4.
[SFM] Laboratory (see Section 202): Group B, unless classified as Group L (see Section 453) or Group H (see Section 307).
[SFM] Laboratory Suites (see Section 453): Group L.
Mercantile (see Section 309): Group M.
Residential (see Section 310): Groups R-1, R-2, R-2.1, R-3, R-3.1 and R-4.
Storage (see Section 311): Groups S-1 and S-2.
Utility and Miscellaneous (see Section 312): Group U.
[SFM] Existing buildings housing existing protective social care homes or facilities established prior to 1972 (see California Fire Code Chapter 11 and California Existing Building Code).

302.2 Use Designation
Occupancy groups contain subordinate uses having similar hazards and risks to building occupants. Uses include, but are not limited to, those functional designations specified within the occupancy group descriptions in Section 302.1. Certain uses require specific limitations and controls in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 and elsewhere in this code.

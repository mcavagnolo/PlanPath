Where positive identification of the heat number cannot be made or where random samples are to be taken, one series of tests shall be made from each 2 1/2 tons (2270 kg) or fraction thereof of each size of reinforcing steel.
Tests of reinforcing bars may be waived by the structural engineer with the approval of the Building Official for one-story buildings or non-building structures provided they are identified in the construction documents and certified mill test reports are provided to the inspector of record for each shipment of such reinforcement.
1910A.3 Tests for Prestressing Steel and Anchorage
All wires or bars of each size from each mill heat and all strands from each manufactured reel to be shipped to the site shall be assigned an individual lot number and shall be tagged in such a manner that each lot can be accurately identified at the jobsite. Each lot of tendon and anchorage assemblies and bar couplers to be installed shall be likewise identified.
The following samples of materials and tendons selected by the engineer or the designated testing laboratory from the prestressing steel at the plant or jobsite shall be furnished by the contractor and tested by an approved independent testing agency:
For wire, strand or bars, 7-foot-long (2134 mm) samples shall be taken of the coil of wire or strand reel or rods. A minimum of one random sample per 5,000 pounds (2270 kg) of each heat or lot used on the job shall be selected.
For prefabricated prestressing tendons other than bars, one completely fabricated tendon 10 feet (3048 mm) in length between grips with anchorage assembly at one end shall be furnished for each size and type of tendon and anchorage assembly.
Variations of the bearing plate size need not be considered.
The anchorages of unbonded tendons shall develop at least 95 percent of the minimum specified ultimate strength of the pre-stressing steel. The total elongation of the tendon under ultimate load shall not be less than 2 percent measured in a minimum gage length of 10 feet (3048 mm).
Anchorages of bonded tendons shall develop at least 90 percent of the minimum specified strength of the prestressing steel tested in an unbonded state. All couplings shall develop at least 95 percent of the minimum specified strength of the prestressing steel and shall not reduce the elongation at rupture below the requirements of the tendon itself.
If the prestressing tendon is a bar, one 7-foot (2134 mm) length complete with one end anchorage shall be furnished and, in addition, if couplers are to be used with the bar, two 4-foot (1219 mm) lengths of bar fabricated to fit and equipped with one coupler shall be furnished.

1910A.4 Composite Construction Cores
Cores of the completed composite concrete construction shall be taken to demonstrate the shear strength along the contact surfaces. The cores shall be tested when the cast-in-place concrete is approximately 28 days old and shall be tested by a shear loading parallel to the joint between the precast concrete and the cast-in-place concrete. The minimum unit shear strength of the contact surface area of the core shall not be less than 100 psi (689 kPa).
At least one core shall be taken from each building for each 5,000 square feet (465 m2) of area of composite concrete construction and not less than three cores shall be taken from each project. The architect or structural engineer in responsible charge of the project or his or her representative shall designate the location for sampling.
1910A.5 Proof Tests for Post-Installed Anchors in Concrete
When post-installed anchors are used in lieu of cast-in place bolts, the proof test loads, frequency and acceptance criteria shall be in accordance with this section.
Exceptions. Proof tests are not required for the following:
Undercut anchors that allow visual confirmation of full set.
Repetitively installed anchors (with 3 or more identical anchors) of diameter one-quarter (1/4) in. or less used for distributed systems or architectural components.

1910A.5.1 General
Test loads or torques, test frequencies, and acceptance criteria shall be shown on the construction documents. If any anchor fails testing, all untested anchors of the same type and installed by the same trade shall be tested until twenty (20) consecutive anchors pass, then resume the initial test frequency.
Anchors to be tested shall be selected at random by the special inspector or inspector of record (IOR), when 100 percent of the anchors are not tested.
The testing of the post-installed anchors shall be done in the presence of the special inspector and a report of the test results shall be submitted to the enforcement agency.
1910A.5.2 Proof Testing Procedure
Post-installed anchors shall be tension tested to verify proper installation in accordance with ASTM E3121 with test frequency and test loads in accordance with Sections 1910A.5.3 and 1910A.5.4, respectively. Tension tests do not require displacement measurement unless specified on the approved construction documents
Exception: Torque-controlled post-installed anchors and screw-type anchors shall be permitted to be tested using torque based on a valid evaluation report and criteria adopted in this code.
1910A.5.3 Test Frequency
1910A.5.3.1 Structural Applications
100 percent of post-installed anchors used for structural applications shall be proof tested.
Exceptions:
Sill bolts. When post-installed anchors are used for sill plate or bottom track bolting applications, 10 percent of the anchors shall be tested.
Rebar dowels. When adhesive anchor systems are used to install reinforcing dowel bars in hardened concrete, 25 percent of the dowels shall be tested if all of the following conditions are met:
The dowels are used exclusively to transmit shear forces across joints between existing and new concrete.
The number of dowels in any one member equals or exceeds 12.
The dowels are uniformly distributed across seismic force resisting members (such as shear walls, collectors and diaphragms).
1910A.5.3.2 Nonstructural Applications
50 percent of post-installed anchors used in nonstructural applications shall be proof tested. The percentage of tested anchors applies to each set of anchors of a common type (e.g., adhesive, wedge, or shell and sleeve for expansion bolts), size, and embedment depth and to each group of anchors. Four or more anchors connected to a common element shall be defined as a group.
Exceptions:
Repetitive anchors. When anchors are used repetitively (with 3 or more identical anchors) in distribution systems (such as pipe, duct or conduit supports) or architectural systems (such as suspended ceilings, cladding, and partitions), 20 percent of anchors, including at least one anchor in each group, shall be tested.
Anchors with low tension. When the design tension on anchors is less than 100 pounds and those anchors are clearly noted on the approved construction documents, 10 percent of anchors shall be tested.
[OSHPD 4] In state detention and correctional facilities, tension testing is not required for post-installed anchors used for attaching nonstructural components, such as grab bars and shower seats, to concrete walls if the components do not contribute to security/detainment, life safety and the continuous operation of the institution following an event of extreme environmental loading from flood, wind, snow or earthquakes, as determined by the enforcing agency.
1910A.5.4 Test Loads
Required test loads shall be determined by one of the following methods:
Twice the maximum allowable tension load or one and a quarter (11/4) times the maximum design strength of anchors as provided in an approved evaluation report using criteria adopted in this code or determined in accordance with Chapter 17 of ACI 318.
Tension test load need not exceed 80 percent of the nominal yield strength of the anchor element (= 0.8 Ase fya).
The manufacturer's recommended installation torque based on an approved evaluation report using criteria adopted in this code.
1910A.5.5 Test Acceptance Criteria
Proof tests shall satisfy the following minimum requirements.
Tension test: Anchors shall be tested in the unconfined condition in accordance with ASTM E3121 except that the minimum clearance to the test frame shall be 1.5 times the anchor's embedment depth. Test load shall be maintained for a minimum of 15 seconds and shall exhibit no discernible movement during the tension test, e.g., as evidenced by loosening of the washer under the nut or an abrupt decrease in the gauge pressure.
Exception: Adhesive anchors shall be permitted to be tested in confined conditions in accordance with ASTM E3121 when the approved construction documents indicate that concrete breakout does not control the design tensile strength.
Torque test: Torque-controlled post-installed anchors tested with a calibrated torque wrench shall attain the specified torque within 1/2 turn of the nut; or one-quarter (1/4) turn of the nut for a 3/8 inch sleeve anchor only.

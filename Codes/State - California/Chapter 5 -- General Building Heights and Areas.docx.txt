(Matrix Adoption Tables are nonregulatory, intended only as an aid to the code user.
See Chapter 1 for state agency authority and building applications.)
The state agency does not adopt sections identified with the following symbol:†
The Office of the State Fire Marshal's adoption of this chapter or individual sections is applicable to structures regulated by other state agencies pursuant to Section 1.11.
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 5 establishes the limits to which a building can be built. Building height, number of stories and building area are specified in this chapter. Chapter 5 must be used in conjunction with the occupancies established in Chapter 3 and the types of construction established in Chapter 6. This chapter also specifies the impact that mezzanines, accessory occupancies and mixed occupancies have on the overall size of a building.
ICC code development note: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F] or [BE] will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.

Unless otherwise specifically modified in Chapter 4 and this chapter, building height, number of stories and building area shall not exceed the limits specified in Sections 504 and 506 based on the type of construction as determined by Section 602 and the occupancies as determined by Section 302 except as modified hereafter. Building height, number of stories and building area provisions shall be applied independently. For the purposes of determining area limitations, height limitations and type of construction, each portion of a building separated by one or more fire walls complying with Section 706 shall be considered to be a separate building.
Exceptions:
[HCD 1] Limited-density owner-built rural dwellings may be of any type of construction which will provide for a sound structural condition. Structural hazards which result in an unsound condition and which may constitute a substandard building are delineated by Section 17920.3 of the Health and Safety Code.
Other than structural requirements, solar photovoltaic panels supported by a structure with no use underneath shall not constitute additional story or additional floor area and may exceed the height limit when constructed on a roof top of a building provided the following conditions are met:
For all occupancies, the highest point of the structure/panel shall meet the lower of the two values below:
3' above the allowable building height per this code.
3' above the roof of the building immediately below.
For installations on flat roofs in other than Group R-3 and R-4 occupancies, the highest point of the structure/panel shall meet the lower of the two values below:
10' above the allowable building height per this code.
10' above the roof of the building immediately below.
Other than structural requirements, solar photovoltaic panels supported by a structure over parking stalls shall not constitute additional story or additional floor area and may exceed the height limit as specified in exception 2 (above) when the following conditions are met (see Figure 5-1):
The area within the perimeter of the photovoltaic array has maximum rectangular dimension of 40 feet by 150 feet.
The distance between solar photovoltaic array structures is a minimum of 10 feet clear.
The driveway aisle separating solar photovoltaic array structures has a minimum width of 25 feet clear.
Solar photovoltaic array structure is used only for parking purposes with no storage.

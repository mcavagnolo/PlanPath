Section 1604A General Design Requirements
1604A.1 General
Building, structures and parts thereof shall be designed and constructed in accordance with strength design, load and resistance factor design, allowable stress design, empirical design or conventional construction methods, as permitted by the applicable material chapters and referenced standards.
1604A.2 Strength
Buildings and other structures, and parts thereof, shall be designed and constructed to support safely the factored loads in load combinations defined in this code without exceeding the appropriate strength limit states for the materials of construction. Alternatively, buildings and other structures, and parts thereof, shall be designed and constructed to support safely the nominal loads in load combinations defined in this code without exceeding the appropriate specified allowable stresses for the materials of construction.
Loads and forces for occupancies or uses not covered in this chapter shall be subject to the approval of the building official.
1604A.3 Serviceability
Structural systems and members thereof shall be designed to have adequate stiffness to limit deflections as indicated in Table 1604A.3.
TABLE 1604A.3—
DEFLECTION LIMITSa, b, c, h, i
For SI: 1 foot = 304.8 mm.
For structural roofing and siding made of formed metal sheets, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/60. For secondary roof structural members supporting formed metal roofing, the live load deflection shall not exceed l/150. For secondary wall members supporting formed metal siding, the design wind load deflection shall not exceed l/90. For roofs, this exception only applies when the metal sheets have no roof covering.
Flexible, folding and portable partitions are not governed by the provisions of this section. The deflection criterion for interior partitions is based on the horizontal load defined in Section 1607A.16.
See Section 2403 for glass supports.
The deflection limit for the D + (L or Lr) load combination only applies to the deflection due to the creep component of long-term dead load deflection plus the short-term live load deflection. For lumber, structural glued laminated timber, prefabricated wood I-joists and structural composite lumber members that are dry at time of installation and used under dry conditions in accordance with the ANSI/AWC NDS, the creep component of the long-term deflection shall be permitted to be estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from 0.5D. For lumber and glued laminated timber members installed or used at all other moisture conditions or cross laminated timber and wood structural panels that are dry at time of installation and used under dry conditions in accordance with the ANSI/AWC NDS, the creep component of the long-term deflection is permitted to be estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from D. The value of 0.5D shall not be used in combination with ANSI/AWC NDS provisions for long-term loading.
The preceding deflections do not ensure against ponding. Roofs that do not have sufficient slope or camber to ensure adequate drainage shall be investigated for ponding. See Chapter 8 of ASCE 7.
The wind load shall be permitted to be taken as 0.42 times the "component and cladding" loads or directly calculated using the 10-year mean return interval basic wind speed, V, for the purpose of determining deflection limits in Table 1604A.3. Where framing members support glass, the deflection limit therein shall not exceed that specified in Section 1604A.3.7
For steel structural members, the deflection due to creep component of long-term dead load shall be permitted to be taken as zero.
For aluminum structural members or aluminum panels used in skylights and sloped glazing framing, roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers not supporting edge of glass or aluminum sandwich panels, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/60. For continuous aluminum structural members supporting edge of glass, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/175 for each glass lite or l/60 for the entire length of the member, whichever is more stringent. For aluminum sandwich panels used in roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/120.
l = Length of the member between supports. For cantilever members, l shall be taken as twice the length of the cantilever.
The snow load shall be permitted to be taken as 0.7 times the design snow load determined in accordance with Section 1608A.1 for the purpose of determining deflection limits in Table 1604A.3.
1604A.3.1 Deflections
The deflections of structural members shall not exceed the more restrictive of the limitations of Sections 1604A.3.2 through 1604A.3.9 or that permitted by Table 1604A.3.
1604A.3.2 Reinforced Concrete
The deflection of reinforced concrete structural members shall not exceed that permitted by ACI 318.
1604A.3.3 Steel
The deflection of steel structural members shall not exceed that permitted by AISC 360, AISI S100, ASCE 8, SJI 100 or SJI 200, as applicable.
1604A.3.4 Masonry
The deflection of masonry structural members shall not exceed that permitted by TMS 402.
1604A.3.5 Aluminum
The deflection of aluminum structural members shall not exceed that permitted by AA ADM.
1604A.3.6 Limits
The deflection limits of Section 1604A.3.1 shall be used unless more restrictive deflection limits are required by a referenced standard for the element or finish material.
1604A.3.7 Framing Supporting Glass
The deflection of framing members supporting glass subjected to 0.6 times the "component and cladding" wind loads shall not exceed either of the following:
1/175 of the length of span of the framing member, for framing members having a length not more than 13 feet 6 inches (4115 mm).
1/240 of the length of span of the framing member + 1/4 inch (6.4 mm), for framing members having a length greater than 13 feet 6 inches (4115 mm).
1604A.3.8 Horizontal Diaphragms
The maximum span-depth ratio for any roof or floor diaphragm consisting of steel and composite steel slab decking shall not exceed those given in Table 1604A.4, unless test data and design calculations acceptable to the enforcement agency are submitted and approved for the use of other span-depth ratios. Concrete diaphragms shall not exceed the span depth ratios for the equivalent composite steel-slab diaphragm in Table 1604A.4.
1604A.3.9 Deflections
Deflection criteria for materials not specified shall be developed by the project architect or structural engineer in a manner consistent with the provisions of this section and approved by the enforcement agency.
1604A.4 Analysis
Load effects on structural members and their connections shall be determined by methods of structural analysis that take into account equilibrium, general stability, geometric compatibility and both short- and long-term material properties.
Members that tend to accumulate residual deformations under repeated service loads shall have included in their analysis the effects of added deformations expected to occur during their service life.
Any system or method of construction to be used shall be based on a rational analysis in accordance with well-established principles of mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system that provides a complete load path capable of transferring loads from their point of origin to the load-resisting elements.
The total lateral force shall be distributed to the various vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system in proportion to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the horizontal bracing system or diaphragm. Rigid elements assumed not to be a part of the lateral force-resisting system are permitted to be incorporated into buildings provided that their effect on the action of the system is considered and provided for in the design. Where a diaphragm is not permitted to be idealized as either flexible or rigid in accordance with ASCE 7 or for wood diaphragms in accordance with AWC SDPWS, the structure shall be analyzed and designed utilizing one of the following procedures:
An envelope analysis of the structure using a flexible and rigid diaphragm analysis separately and designing each component for the more severe load condition.
A semirigid diaphragm analysis and design.
Where required by ASCE 7, provisions shall be made for the increased forces induced on resisting elements of the structural system resulting from torsion due to eccentricity between the center of application of the lateral forces and the center of rigidity of the lateral force-resisting system.
Every structure shall be designed to resist the effects caused by the forces specified in this chapter, including overturning, uplift and sliding. Where sliding is used to isolate the elements, the effects of friction between sliding elements shall be included as a force.
TABLE 1604A.4
MAXIMUM HORIZONTAL DIAPHRAGM SPAN AND SPAN-DEPTH RATIOS 1, 3, 4
For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 plf = 14.594 N/m, 1 psi = 6894 Pa
Diaphragms shall satisfy span-depth limitations based on flexibility.
Flexibility factor (F) is the average deflection in micro inches (10-6) or µm of the diaphragm web per foot (m) of span stressed with a shear of 1 pound per foot (N/m).
The total deflection Δ of the diaphragm may be computed from the equation: Δ = Δf + Δw.
Where:
Δf = Flexural deflection of the diaphragm determined in the same manner as the deflection of beams. The flexural stiffness of the web of diaphragms consisting of bare steel decking shall be neglected.
Δw   = Web deflection of the diaphragm may be determined solving the following equation:

Where:
L = Distance in feet (m) between the vertical resisting element (such as a shear wall) and the point to which the deflection is to be determined.
qave = Average shear in the diaphragm in pounds per foot (N/m) over length L.
When applying these limitations to cantilevered diaphragms, the allowable span-depth ratio will be half of that shown.
1604A.5 Risk Category
Each building and structure shall be assigned a risk category in accordance with Table 1604A.5. Where a referenced standard specifies an occupancy category, the risk category shall not be taken as lower than the occupancy category specified therein. Where a referenced standard specifies that the assignment of a risk category be in accordance with ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1, Table 1604A.5 shall be used in lieu of ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1.
Exceptions:

The facility has on-site supplies of water and holding tanks for sewage and liquid waste, sufficient to support 72 hours of emergency operations for the hospital or building, which are integrated into the building plumbing systems in accordance with the California Plumbing Code.
An on-site emergency system as defined in the California Electrical Code is incorporated into the building electrical system for critical care areas. Additionally, the system shall provide for radiological service and an onsite fuel supply for 72 hours of acute care operation.
Emergency and standby generators shall not be located below the higher of the Design Flood Elevation (DFE) or Base Flood Elevation (BFE) plus two feet (BFE + 2 ft.) or 500 year flood elevation, whichever is higher, and shall be located at an elevation close to grade for easy accessibility from outside for maintenance.
1617A.1.41 Peer Review Requirements
[OSHPD 1, 1R, 2 & 5]
General. Independent peer review is an objective technical review by knowledgeable reviewer(s) experienced in structural design, analysis and performance issues involved. The reviewer(s) shall examine the available information on the condition of the building, basic engineering concept employed and recommendations for action.
Exception: OSHPD may perform the work of peer review when qualified staff is available.
Timing of Independent Review. The independent reviewer (s) shall be selected prior to initiation of substantial portion of the design and analysis work that is to be reviewed, and review shall start as soon as practical and sufficient information defining the project is available.
Qualifications and Terms of Employment. The reviewer shall be independent from the design and construction team.
The reviewer(s) shall have no other involvement in the project before, during or after the review, except in a review capacity.
The reviewer shall be selected and paid by owner and shall have technical expertise similar to the project being reviewed, as determined by enforcement agent.
The reviewer (in case of review team, the chair) shall be a California-licensed structural engineer who is familiar with technical issues and regulations governing the work to be reviewed.
The reviewer shall serve through completion of the project and shall not be terminated except for failure to perform the duties specified herein. Such termination shall be in writing with copies to enforcement agent, owner and the engineer of record. When a reviewer is terminated or resigns, a qualified replacement shall be appointed within 10 working days or a timeframe mutually agreed to by the Owner, Registered Design Professional (RDP) and the Office.
Scope of Review. Review activities shall include, where appropriate, available construction documents, design criteria, observation of the condition of structure, all new and original inspection reports, including methods of sampling, analyses prepared by the engineer of record and consultants, and the new, retrofit or repair design. Review shall include consideration of the proposed design approach, method, materials and details.
Reports. The reviewer(s) shall prepare a written report to the owner and responsible enforcement agent that covers all aspect of the review performed including conclusions reached by the reviewer. Report shall be issued after the schematic phase, during design development, and at the completion of construction documents, but prior to their issuance of permit. Such report shall include, at the minimum, statement of the following:
Scope of engineering design peer review with limitations defined.
The status of the project documents at each review stage.
Ability of selected materials and framing systems to meet the performance criteria with given loads and configuration.
Degree of structural system redundancy and the deformation compatibility among structural and nonstructural elements.
Basic constructability of the new, retrofit or repair system.
Other recommendation that will be appropriate for the specific project.
Presentation of the conclusions of the reviewer identifying any areas that need further review, investigation and/or clarification.
Recommendations.

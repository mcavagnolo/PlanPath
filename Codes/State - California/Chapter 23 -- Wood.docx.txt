CHAPTER 23 — WOOD
(Matrix Adoption Tables are nonregulatory, intended only as an aid to the code user.
See Chapter 1 for state agency authority and building applications.)
The state agency does not adopt sections identified with the following symbol: †
The Office of the State Fire Marshal's adoption of this chapter or individual sections is applicable to structures regulated by other state agencies pursuant to Section 1.11.
User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 23 provides minimum requirements for the design of buildings and structures that use wood and wood-based products. The chapter is organized around three design methodologies: allowable stress design (ASD), load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and conventional light-frame construction. In addition it allows the use of the American Wood Council Wood Frame Construction Manual for a limited range of structures. Included in the chapter are references to design and manufacturing standards for various wood and wood-based products; general construction requirements; design criteria for lateral force-resisting systems and specific requirements for the application of the three design methods.
ICC code development note: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.

NJ = Number of jack studs required to support each end. Where the number of required jack studs equals one, the header is permitted to be supported by an approved framing anchor attached to the full-height wall stud and to the header.
Spans are calculated assuming the top of the header or girder is laterally braced by perpendicular framing. Where the top of the header or girder is not laterally braced (for example, cripple studs bearing on the header), tabulated spans for headers consisting of 2 × 8, 2 × 10, or 2 × 12 sizes shall be multiplied by 0.70 or the header or girder shall be designed.

For allowable stress design snow loads less than 30 pounds per square foot, the required number of nails is permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the ratio of actual snow load plus 10 divided by 40, but not less than the number required for no snow load.
Applies to roof live load of 20 psf or less.
Tabulated heel joint connection requirements assume that ceiling joists or rafter ties are located at the bottom of the attic space. Where ceiling joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic, heel joint connection requirements shall be increased by the adjustment factors in Table 2308.11.3.1(1).
Tabulated requirements are based on 10 psf roof dead load in combination with the specified roof snow load and roof live load.
TABLE 2308.11.3.1(1)—
HEEL JOINT CONNECTION ADJUSTMENT FACTORS
H C   = Height of ceiling joists or rafter ties measured vertically from the top of the rafter support walls to the bottom of the ceiling joists or rafter ties;
HR   = Height of roof ridge measured vertically from the top of the rafter support walls to the bottom of the roof ridge.
Where H C/HR exceeds 1/3, connections shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice.
2308.11.4 Wind Uplift
Diagram
The roof construction shall have rafter and truss ties to the wall below. Resultant uplift loads shall be transferred to the foundation using a continuous load path. The rafter or truss to wall connection shall comply with Tables 2304.10.2 and 2308.11.4.
Exception: The truss to wall connection shall be determined from the uplift forces as specified on the truss design drawings or as shown on the construction documents.
TABLE 2308.11.4—
REQUIRED RATING OF APPROVED UPLIFT CONNECTORS (pounds)a, b, c, e, f, g, h, d
For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 mile per hour = 1.61 km/hr, 1 pound = 0.454 Kg, 1 pound/foot = 14.5939 N/m.
The uplift connection requirements are based on a 33-foot mean roof height.
The uplift connection requirements are based on the framing being spaced 24 inches on center. Multiply by 0.67 for framing spaced 16 inches on center and multiply by 0.5 for framing spaced 12 inches on center.
The uplift connection requirements include an allowance for 10 pounds of dead load.
The uplift connection requirements include for the effects of 24-inch overhangs.
The uplift connection requirements are based on wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 28.3-1 of ASCE 7. Connection loads for connections located a distance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimension of the building from the corner of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table connection value by 0.75.
For wall-to-wall and wall-to-foundation connections, the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds for each full wall above. (For example, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the next floor level down).
Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of V and roof spans.
The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to include up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications. The required rating of approved uplift connectors is based on allowable stress design loads.
V shall be determined in accordance with Section 1609.3.

2308.11.5 Framing Around Openings
Trimmer and header rafters shall be doubled, or of lumber of equivalent cross section, where the span of the header exceeds 4 feet (1219 mm). The ends of header rafters that are more than 6 feet (1829 mm) in length shall be supported by framing anchors or rafter hangers unless bearing on a beam, partition or wall.
2308.11.5.1 Openings in Roof Diaphragms in Seismic Design Categories B, C, D and E
In buildings classified as Seismic Design Category B, C, D or E. openings in horizontal diaphragms with a dimension that is greater than 4 feet (1219 mm) shall be constructed with metal ties and blocking in accordance with this section and Figure 2308.8.4.1(1). Metal ties shall be not less than 0.058 inch [1.47 mm (16 galvanized gage)] in thickness by 11/2 inches (38 mm) in width and shall have a yield stress not less than 33,000 psi (227 MPa). Blocking shall extend not less than the dimension of the opening in the direction of the tie and blocking. Ties shall be attached to blocking in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions but with not less than eight 16d common nails on each side of the header-joist intersection.
2308.11.6 Purlins
Purlins to support roof loads are permitted to be installed to reduce the span of rafters within allowable limits and shall be supported by struts to bearing walls. The maximum span of 2-inch by 4-inch (51 mm by 102 mm) purlins shall be 4 feet (1219 mm). The maximum span of the 2-inch by 6-inch (51 mm by 152 mm) purlin shall be 6 feet (1829 mm), but the purlin shall not be smaller than the supported rafter. Struts shall be not less than 2-inch by 4-inch (51 mm by 102 mm) members. The unbraced length of struts shall not exceed 8 feet (2438 mm) and the slope of the struts shall be not less than 45 degrees (0.79 rad) from the horizontal.
2308.11.7 Blocking
Roof rafters and ceiling joists shall be supported laterally to prevent rotation and lateral displacement in accordance with Section 2308.8.6 and connected to braced wall lines in accordance with Section 2308.10.7.2.

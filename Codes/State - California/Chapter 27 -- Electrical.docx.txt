CALIFORNIA BUILDING CODE — MATRIX ADOPTION TABLE
CHAPTER 27 — ELECTRICAL
(Matrix Adoption Tables are nonregulatory, intended only as an aid to the code user.
See Chapter 1 for state agency authority and building applications.)
The state agency does not adopt sections identified with the following symbol: †
The Office of the State Fire Marshal's adoption of this chapter or individual sections is applicable to structures regulated by other state agencies pursuant to Section 1.11.
User notes:
About this chapter: Electrical systems and components are integral to most structures; therefore, it is necessary for the code to address their installation and protection. Structures depend on electricity for the operation of many life safety systems including fire alarm, smoke control and exhaust, fire suppression, fire command and communication systems. Since power supply to these systems is essential, Chapter 27 addresses where standby and emergency power must be provided.
ICC code development note: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the IFC code development committee meeting during the 2024 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered by a code development committee meeting during the 2025 (Group B) Code Development Cycle.

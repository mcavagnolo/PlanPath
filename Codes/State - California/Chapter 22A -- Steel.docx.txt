Section 2215A [DSA-SS] Light Modular Steel Moment Frames for Public Elementary and Secondary Schools, and Community Colleges
2215A.1 General
2215A.1.1 Configuration
Light modular steel moment frame buildings shall be constructed of factory-assembled modules comprising a single-story moment-resisting space frame supporting a floor and roof. Individual modules shall not exceed a width of 14 feet (4.25 m) nor a length of 72 feet (22 m). All connections of beams to corner columns shall be designed as moment-resisting in accordance with the criteria of Section 2215A.2. Modules may be stacked to form multistory structures not exceeding 35 feet or two stories in height. When stacked modules are evaluated separately, seismic forces on each module shall be distributed in accordance with Section 12.8.3 of ASCE 7, considering the modules in the stacked condition. See Section 2215A.2.5 of this code.
2215A.1.2 Design, Fabrication and Erection
The design, fabrication and erection of light modular steel moment-frame buildings shall be in accordance with the AISC Specification for Structural Steel Buildings (ANSI/AISC 360) and the AISI North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (AISI S100), as applicable, and the requirements of this section. The maximum dead load of the roof and elevated floor shall not exceed 25 psf and 50 psf (1197 Pa and 2394 Pa), respectively. The maximum dead load of the exterior walls shall not exceed 45 psf (2155 Pa).
2215A.2 Seismic Requirements
In addition to the other requirements of this code, the design, materials and workmanship of light modular steel moment frames shall comply with the requirements of this section. The response modification coefficient R shall be equal to 3 1/2. Cd and Ω0 shall be equal to 3.0.
2215A.2.1 Base Materials
Beams, columns and connection materials shall be limited to those materials permitted under the AISC Specification for Structural Members (ANSI/AISC 360) and the AISI North American Specification for the Design of Cold-Formed Steel Structural Members (AISI S100). All columns shall conform with standard AISC 360 shapes.
2215A.2.2 Beam-to-Column Strength Ratio
At each moment-resisting connection the following shall apply:

(Equation 22A-1)
where:
Fybi = The specified yield stress of beam "i."
Fycj = The specified yield stress of column "j."
Sbi = The flexural section modulus of each beam "i" that is moment connected to the column "j" at the connection.
Scj = The flexural section modulus of each column "j" that is moment connected to the beam "i" at the connection.
Exceptions:
Beam-to-column connections at the floor level beams of first or second-story modules need not comply with this requirement.
Beam-to-column strength ratios less than 1.4 are allowed if proven to be acceptable by analysis or testing.
2215A.2.3 Welding
Weld filler metals shall be capable of producing weld metal with a minimum Charpy V-Notch toughness of 20 ft-lb at 0°F. Where beam bottom flanges attach to columns with complete joint penetration groove welds and weld backing is used at the bottom surface of the beam flange, such backing shall be removed and the root pass back-gouged, repaired and reinforced with a minimum 3/16 inch (5 mm) fillet weld.
2215A.2.4 Connection Design
Connections of beams to columns shall have the design strength to resist the maximum seismic load effect, Em, calculated in accordance with Section 12.4.3 of ASCE 7.
2215A.2.5 Multistory Assemblies
Analysis of multistory assemblies shall be permitted to consider the stacked modules as a single assembly, with restraint conditions between the stacked units that represent the actual method of attachment. Alternatively, it shall be permitted to analyze the individual modules of stacked assemblies independently, with lateral and vertical reactions from modules above applied as concentrated loads at the top of the supporting module.
Section 2216A Testing and Field Verification
2216A.1 Tests of High-Strength Bolts, Nuts and Washers
High-strength bolts, nuts and washers shall be sampled and tested in accordance with Section 1705A.2.8 [OSHPD 1 & 4] and this section.
[OSHPD 1 and 4] A minimum of nine samples per lot, as defined in the ASTM standards for bolts [not nuts and washers], shall be tested for tensile properties in accordance with ASTM F606, but need not exceed three samples per 400 bolts.
2216A.2 Tests of End-Welded Studs
End-welded studs shall be tested in accordance with the requirements of the AWS D1.1, Clauses 9.7 and 9.8.
Exception: Fillet-welded studs exempted by AWS D1.1 Clause 9.5.

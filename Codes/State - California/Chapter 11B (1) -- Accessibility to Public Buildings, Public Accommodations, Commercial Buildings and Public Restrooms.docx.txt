Where existing elements or spaces are altered, each altered element or space shall comply with the applicable requirements of Division 2, including Section 11B-202.4.
Exceptions:
Reserved.
Technically infeasible. In alterations, where the enforcing authority determines compliance with applicable requirements is technically infeasible, the alteration shall provide equivalent facilitation or comply with the requirements to the maximum extent feasible. The details of the finding that full compliance with the requirements is technically infeasible shall be recorded and entered into the files of the enforcing agency.
Residential dwelling units not required to be accessible in compliance with this code shall not be required to comply with Section 11B-202.3.
11B-202.3.1 Prohibited Reduction in Access

11B-202.3.2 Extent of Application
An alteration of an existing element, space or area of a building or facility shall not impose a requirement for accessibility greater than required for new construction.
11B-202.3.3 Alteration of Single Elements
If alterations of single elements, when considered together, amount to an alteration of a room or space in a building or facility, the entire room or space shall be made accessible.
11B-202.4 Path of Travel Requirements in Alterations, Additions and Structural Repairs
Diagram
When alterations or additions are made to existing buildings or facilities, an accessible path of travel to the specific area of alteration or addition shall be provided. The primary accessible path of travel shall include:
A primary entrance to the building or facility,
Toilet and bathing facilities serving the area,
Drinking fountains serving the area,
Public telephones serving the area, and
Signs.
Exceptions:
Residential dwelling units shall comply with Section 11B-233.3.4.2.
If the following elements of a path of travel have been constructed or altered in compliance with the accessibility requirements of the immediately preceding edition of the California Building Code, it shall not be required to retrofit such elements to reflect the incremental changes in this code solely because of an alteration to an area served by those elements of the path of travel:
A primary entrance to the building or facility,
Toilet and bathing facilities serving the area,
Drinking fountains serving the area,
Public telephones serving the area, and
Signs.
Note: The language in this exception, which refers to the "immediately preceding edition of the California Building Code," shall permit a reference back to one CBC edition only and is not accumulative to prior editions.
Additions or alterations to meet accessibility requirements consisting of one or more of the following items shall be limited to the actual scope of work of the project and shall not be required to comply with Section 11B-202.4:
Altering one building entrance.
Altering one existing toilet facility.
Altering existing elevators.
Altering existing steps.
Altering existing handrails.
Alterations solely for the purpose of barrier removal undertaken pursuant to the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Public Law 101-336, 28 C.F.R., Section 36.304) or the accessibility requirements of this code as those requirements or regulations now exist or are hereafter amended including, but not limited to, one or more of the following items shall be limited to the actual scope of work of the project and shall not be required to comply with Section 11B-202.4:
Installing ramps.
Making curb cuts in sidewalks and entrance.
Repositioning shelves.
Rearranging tables, chairs, vending machines, display racks and other furniture.
Repositioning telephones.
Adding raised markings on elevator control buttons.
Installing flashing alarm lights.
Widening doors.
Installing offset hinges to widen doorways.
Eliminating a turnstile or providing an alternative accessible route.
Installing accessible door hardware.
Installing grab bars in toilet stalls.
Rearranging toilet partitions to increase maneuvering space.
Insulating lavatory pipes under sinks to prevent burns.
Installing a raised toilet seat.
Installing a full-length bathroom mirror.
Repositioning the paper towel dispenser in a bathroom.
Creating designated accessible parking spaces.
Removing high-pile, low-density carpeting.
Alterations of existing parking lots by resurfacing and/or restriping shall be limited to the actual scope of work of the project and shall not be required to comply with Section 11B-202.4.
The addition or replacement of signs and/or identification devices shall be limited to the actual scope of work of the project and shall not be required to comply with Section 11B-202.4.
Projects consisting only of heating, ventilation, air conditioning, reroofing, electrical work not involving placement of switches and receptacles, cosmetic work that does not affect items regulated by this code, such as painting, equipment not considered to be a part of the architecture of the building or area, such as computer terminals and office equipment shall not be required to comply with Section 11B-202.4 unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.
When the adjusted construction cost, as defined, is less than or equal to the current valuation threshold, as defined, the cost of compliance with Section 11B-202.4 shall be limited to 20 percent of the adjusted construction cost of alterations, structural repairs or additions. When the cost of full compliance with Section 11B-202.4 would exceed 20 percent, compliance shall be provided to the greatest extent possible without exceeding 20 percent.
When the adjusted construction cost, as defined, exceeds the current valuation threshold, as defined, and the enforcing agency determines the cost of compliance with Section 11B-202.4 is an unreasonable hardship, as defined, full compliance with Section 11B-202.4 shall not be required. Compliance shall be provided by equivalent facilitation or to the greatest extent possible without creating an unreasonable hardship; but in no case shall the cost of compliance be less than 20 percent of the adjusted construction cost of alterations, structural repairs or additions. The details of the finding of unreasonable hardship shall be recorded and entered into the files of the enforcing agency and shall be subject to Chapter 1, Section 1.9.1.5, Special Conditions for Persons with Disabilities Requiring Appeals Action Ratification.
For the purposes of this exception, the adjusted construction cost of alterations, structural repairs or additions shall not include the cost of alterations to path of travel elements required to comply with Section 11B-202.4.
In choosing which accessible elements to provide, priority should be given to those elements that will provide the greatest access in the following order:
An accessible entrance;
An accessible route to the altered area;
At least one accessible restroom for each sex or one accessible unisex (single-user or family) restroom;
Accessible telephones;
Accessible drinking fountains; and
When possible, additional accessible elements such as parking, signs, storage and alarms.
If an area has been altered without providing an accessible path of travel to that area, and subsequent alterations of that area or a different area on the same path of travel are undertaken within three years of the original alteration, the total cost of alterations to the areas on that path of travel during the preceding three-year period shall be considered in determining whether the cost of making that path of travel accessible is disproportionate.
Certain types of privately funded, multistory buildings and facilities were formerly exempt from accessibility requirements above and below the first floor under this code, but as of April 1, 1994 are no longer exempt due to more restrictive provisions in the federal Americans with Disabilities Act. In alteration projects involving buildings and facilities previously approved and built without elevators, areas above and below the ground floor are subject to the 20-percent disproportionality provisions described in Exception 8, above, even if the value of the project exceeds the valuation threshold in Exception 8. The types of buildings and facilities are:
Office buildings and passenger vehicle service stations of three stories or more and 3,000 or more square feet (279 m2) per floor.
Offices of physicians and surgeons.
Shopping centers.
Other buildings and facilities three stories or more and 3,000 or more square feet (279 m2) per floor if a reasonable portion of services sought and used by the public is available on the accessible level.
For the general privately funded multistory building exception applicable to new construction and alterations, see Section 11B-206.2.3, Exception 1.
The elevator exception set forth in this section does not obviate or limit in any way the obligation to comply with the other accessibility requirements in this code. For example, floors above or below the accessible ground floor must meet the requirements of this section except for elevator service. If toilet or bathing facilities are provided on a level not served by an elevator, then toilet or bathing facilities must be provided on the accessible ground floor.
Alterations solely for the purpose of installing electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) at facilities where vehicle fueling, recharging, parking or storage is a primary function shall comply with Section 11B-202.4 to the maximum extent feasible without exceeding 20 percent of the cost of the work directly associated with the installation of EVCS. A "primary function" is a major activity for which the facility is intended.
Alterations solely for the purpose of installing EVCS at facilities where vehicle fueling, recharging, parking or storage is not a primary function shall not be required to comply with Section 11B-202.4

Except as provided for in Section 11B-233.3.1.2.5, the provisions of this section do not apply to multistory dwelling units in non-elevator buildings.
11B-233.3.1.2.6.1 Single Building With One Common (Lobby) Entrance
The following may only be used for determining required access to multifamily dwelling units, in a single building with one common (lobby) entrance, located on a site with difficult terrain conditions or unusual characteristics:
All ground floor units in non-elevator buildings shall be adaptable and on an accessible route unless an accessible route to the common (lobby) entrance is not required as determined by Test No. 1, Individual Building Test, or Test No. 3, Unusual Characteristics Test, as described in this section.
Sites where either Test No. 1 or Test No. 3 is used and it is determined that an accessible route to the common (lobby) entrance is not required, a minimum of 20 percent of the ground floor dwelling units shall comply with Section 11B-809.6, and all remaining ground floor dwelling units shall comply with the features listed in Section 11B-233.3.1.2.6.5 unless exempted by Test No. 3, Unusual Characteristics Test.
Test No. 1—Individual Building Test may only be used if the site has terrain over 15 percent slope.
Test No. 3—Unusual Characteristics Test may be used if applicable.
Provisions to Test Nos. 1 and 2. Where a building elevator is provided only as means of creating an accessible route to dwelling units on a ground floor, the building is not considered to be an elevator building for purposes of this code; hence, only the ground floor dwelling units would be covered.
11B-233.3.1.2.6.2 Test Number One, Individual Building Test
It is not required by this code to provide an accessible route when the terrain of the site is such that both of the following apply:
The slopes of the undisturbed site measured in a straight line between the planned entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance exceed 15 percent; and
The slopes of the planned finished grade measured between the entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance also exceed 15 percent.
If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, the slope for the purposes of Test No. 1 will be measured to the closest vehicular or pedestrian arrival point.
For purposes of these requirements, vehicular or pedestrian site arrival points include public or resident parking areas, public transportation stops, passenger loading zones and public streets or sidewalks. To determine site impracticality, the slope would be measured at ground level from the point of the planned entrance on a straight line to:
Each vehicular or pedestrian arrival point that is within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, or
If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within the specified area, the vehicular or pedestrian arrival point closest to the planned entrance.
In the case of sidewalks, the closest point to the entrance will be where a public sidewalk entering the site intersects with the walk to the entrance. In the case of resident parking areas, the closest point to the planned entrance will be measured from the entry point to the parking area that is located closest to the planned entrance.
11B-233.3.1.2.6.3 Test Number Two, Site Analysis Test
For a site having multiple buildings, or a site with a single building with multiple entrances, it is not required to provide a building entrance on an accessible route to all ground floor units under the following conditions:
Calculate the percentage of the total buildable area of the undisturbed site with a natural grade less than 10 percent slope. The analysis of the existing slope (before grading) shall be done on a topographic survey with 2 foot (610 mm) contour intervals with slope determination made between each successive interval. The accuracy of the slope analysis shall be certified by a licensed engineer, landscape architect, architect or surveyor.
Determine the requirement of providing an accessible route to planned multifamily dwellings based on the topography of the existing natural terrain. The minimum percentage of ground floor units required on an accessible route shall equal the percentage of the total buildable area (not restricted-use areas, flood plains or wetlands) of the undisturbed site with an existing natural grade of less than 10 percent slope.
In addition to the percentage established in paragraph (2), all ground floor units in a building, or ground floor units served by a particular entrance on an accessible route defined by a calculation of the straight line slope not exceeding 8.33 percent, between their planned entrances and an arrival point, shall be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Section 11B-809.6.
All additional ground floor units in a building, or ground floor units served by a particular entrance, not on an accessible route shall comply with the features listed in Section 11B-233.3.1.2.6.5.
In no case shall less than 20 percent of the ground floor dwelling units be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Sections 11B-809.6 through 11B-809.12.
11B-233.3.1.2.6.4 Test Number Three, Unusual Characteristics Test
Unusual characteristics include sites located in a state or federally designated floodplain or coastal high-hazard areas and sites subject to other similar requirements of law or code that require the lowest floor or the lowest structural member of the lowest floor be designed to a specified level at or above the base flood elevation. An accessible route to a building entrance is impractical due to unusual characteristics of the site when:
The original site characteristics result in a difference in finished grade elevation exceeding 30 inches (762 mm) and 10 percent measured between an entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance; or
If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, the unusual characteristics result in a difference in finished grade elevation exceeding 30 inches (762 mm) and 10 percent measured between an entrance and the closest vehicular or pedestrian arrival point.
11B-233.3.1.2.6.5 Additional Requirements

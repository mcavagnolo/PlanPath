Section 1106A Site and Building Characteristics
1106A.1 General
Diagram
Covered multifamily dwellings with elevators shall be designed and constructed to provide at least one accessible entrance on an accessible route, regardless of terrain or unusual characteristics of the site. Covered multifamily dwellings without elevators shall be designed and constructed to provide at least one accessible entrance on an accessible route unless terrain or unusual characteristics of the site prevent an accessible route based on the conditions listed below:
Accessible Entrance. Regardless of site considerations described in Section 1150A, an accessible entrance on an accessible route is required when there is an elevator connecting the parking area with the dwelling units on a ground floor. (In this case, those dwelling units on the ground floor served by an elevator and at least one of each type of public- and common-use areas, would be subject to these requirements.)
Elevator building. When a building elevator or elevators are provided as a means of access to dwelling units other than dwelling units on a ground floor (see Section 1104A.2), the building is an elevator building. All dwelling units become covered multifamily dwellings in that building. The elevator in that building must provide accessibility to all dwelling units in the building, regardless of the slope of the natural terrain. For multistory dwelling units in buildings with one or more elevators, see Section 1102A.3.2.
Note: Where a building elevator is provided only as means of creating an accessible route to covered multifamily dwelling units on a ground floor, the building is not considered to be an elevator building, only dwelling units located on the ground floor shall be required to comply with this chapter.
Elevated walkway. When an elevated walkway is planned between a building entrance and a vehicular or pedestrian arrival point and the planned walkway has a slope no greater than 10 percent (1 unit vertical in 10 units horizontal), the floor being served by the elevated walkway becomes a ground floor and accessibility to all dwellings on that ground floor is required.
Note: Since the planned walkway meets the 10 percent slope criterion, it is required to provide an accessible route to the entrance and the slope of the walkway must be reduced to 1 unit vertical in 12 units horizontal (8.33 percent slope) maximum.

When a building or portion of a building is required to be accessible or adaptable, an accessible route shall be provided to all portions of the building, accessible building entrances and between the building and the public way. The accessible route shall be the most practical direct route and to the maximum extent feasible, coincide with the route for the general public and building residents.
Exterior accessible routes shall be provided as follows:
At least one accessible route within the boundary of the site shall be provided from public transportation stops, accessible parking and accessible passenger loading and unloading zones, and public streets or sidewalks to the accessible building entrance they serve. Where more than one route of travel is provided, all routes shall be accessible.
At least one accessible route shall connect accessible buildings, facilities, elements and spaces that are on the same site. Accessible routes shall be provided between accessible buildings and accessible site facilities when more than one building or facility is located on a site.
At least one accessible route shall connect accessible building or facility entrances with all accessible spaces, elements and covered multifamily dwelling units.
An accessible route shall connect at least one accessible entrance of each covered multifamily dwelling unit with exterior spaces and facilities that serve the dwelling unit.
Where elevators are provided for vertical access, all elevators shall be accessible. See Section 1124A.

Division VI Site Impracticality Tests
Section 1150A Site Impracticality Tests
1150A.1 General
Covered multifamily dwellings in buildings without an elevator, located on sites with difficult terrain conditions or unusual characteristics, may employ the site impracticality tests in this division for determining the accessibility and adaptability provisions required by this chapter.
Except as provided for in Section 1102A.3.1, the provisions of this section do not apply to multistory dwelling units in nonelevator buildings.
Provisions to Test Nos. 1 and 2. Where a building elevator is provided only as means of creating an accessible route to covered multifamily dwelling units on a ground floor, the building is not considered to be an elevator building for purposes of this code; hence, only the ground floor dwelling units would be covered.
Test No. 1—Individual Building Test
It is not required by this code to provide an accessible route when the terrain of the site is such that both of the following apply:
The slopes of the undisturbed site measured between the planned entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance exceed 15 percent; and
The slopes of the planned finished grade measured between the entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance also exceed 15 percent.
If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, the slope for the purposes of Test No. 1 will be measured to the closest vehicular or pedestrian arrival point.
For purposes of these requirements, vehicular or pedestrian arrival points include public or resident parking areas, public transportation stops, passenger loading zones and public streets or sidewalks. To determine site impracticality, the slope would be measured at ground level from the point of the planned entrance on a straight line to (1) each vehicular or pedestrian arrival point that is within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, or (2) if there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within the specified area, the vehicular or pedestrian arrival point closest to the planned entrance. In the case of sidewalks, the closest point to the entrance will be where a public sidewalk entering the site intersects with the walk to the entrance. In the case of resident parking areas, the closest point to the planned entrance will be measured from the entry point to the parking area that is located closest to the planned entrance.
Test No. 2—Site Analysis Test
For a site having multiple buildings, or a site with a single building with multiple entrances, it is not required to provide an accessible route to all ground floor units under the following conditions:
Calculate the percentage of the total buildable area of the undisturbed site with a natural grade less than 10-percent slope. The analysis of the existing slope (before grading) shall be done on a topographic survey with 2-foot (610 mm) contour intervals with slope determination made between each successive interval. The accuracy of the slope analysis shall be certified by a licensed engineer, landscape architect, architect or surveyor.
Determine the requirement of providing an accessible route to planned multifamily dwellings based on the topography of the existing natural terrain. The minimum percentage of ground floor units required on an accessible route shall equal the percentage of the total buildable area (not restricted-use areas) of the undisturbed site with an existing natural grade of less than 10-percent slope. In no case shall less than 20 percent of the ground floor dwelling units be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Division IV.
In addition to the percentage established in paragraph (2), all additional ground floor units in a building or ground floor units served by a particular entrance, that fall within an 8.33-percent slope between their planned entrances and an arrival point shall be on an accessible route and comply with the provisions of Division IV.
All additional ground floor units in a building, or ground floor units served by a particular entrance, not on an accessible route shall comply with the features listed in Section 1150A.2.
Test No. 3—Unusual Characteristics Test
Unusual characteristics include sites located in a state or federally designated floodplain or coastal high-hazard areas and sites subject to other similar requirements of law or code that require the lowest floor or the lowest structural member of the lowest floor to be designed to a specified level at or above the base flood elevation. An accessible route to a building entrance is impractical due to unusual characteristics of the site when:
The original site characteristics result in a difference in finished grade elevation exceeding 30 inches (762 mm) and 10 percent measured between an entrance and all vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance; or
If there are no vehicular or pedestrian arrival points within 50 feet (15 240 mm) of the planned entrance, the unusual characteristics result in a difference in finished grade elevation exceeding 30 inches (762 mm) and 10 percent measured between an entrance and the closest vehicular or pedestrian arrival point.
1150A.2 Additional Requirements for Section 1150A
All other ground floor dwelling units in nonelevator buildings shall be made to comply with the following requirements:
Grab bar reinforcement: see Section 1134A.
Thirty-two inch (813 mm) clear door interior opening width: see Section 1132A.3.
Lever hardware: see Section 1132A.8.
Door signal devices: see Section 1132A.10.
Clear space by doors: see Chapters 10 and 11A.
Minimum 15-inch (381 mm) water closet seat height: see Section 1134A.7, Item 3.
Electrical receptacle outlet height: see Section 1136A.
Lighting and environmental control height: see Section 1136A.
Faucet controls: see Section 1134A.8, Item 7.
Water closet, bathtub and lavatory minimum space requirements: see Section 1134A.
Removable cabinets under the kitchen sink counter area: see Section 1133A.3.

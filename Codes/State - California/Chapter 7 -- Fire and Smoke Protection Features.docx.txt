Section 703 Fire-Resistance Ratings and Fire Tests
703.1 Scope
Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.
703.2 Fire Resistance
The fire-resistance rating of building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined in accordance with Section 703.2.1 or 703.2.2 without the use of automatic sprinklers or any other fire suppression system being incorporated, or in accordance with Section 703.2.3.
703.2.1 Tested Assemblies
A fire-resistance rating of building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E119 or UL 263. The fire-resistance rating of penetrations and fire-resistant joint systems shall be determined in accordance with Sections 714 and 715, respectively.
703.2.1.1 Nonsymmetrical Wall Construction
Interior walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest duration obtained from the two tests conducted in compliance with ASTM E119 or UL 263. Where evidence is furnished to show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side exposed to the furnace, subject to acceptance of the building official, the wall need not be subjected to tests from the opposite side (see Section 705.5 for exterior walls).
703.2.1.2 Combustible Components
Combustible aggregates are permitted in gypsum and Portland cement concrete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated construction. Any component material or admixture is permitted in assemblies if the resulting tested assembly meets the fire-resistance test requirements of this code.
703.2.1.3 Restrained Classification
Diagram
Fire-resistance-rated assemblies tested under ASTM E119 or UL 263 shall not be considered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory to the building official is furnished by the registered design professional showing that the construction qualifies for a restrained classification in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263.

705.3 Buildings on the Same Lot
Diagram
For the purposes of determining the required wall and opening protection, projections and roof-covering requirements, buildings on the same lot shall be assumed to have an imaginary line between them.
Where a new building is to be erected on the same lot as an existing building, the location of the assumed imaginary line with relation to the existing building shall be such that the exterior wall and opening protection of the existing building meet the criteria as set forth in Sections 705.5 and 705.9.
Exceptions:
Two or more buildings on the same lot shall be either regulated as separate buildings or shall be considered as portions of one building if the aggregate area of such buildings is within the limits specified in Chapter 5 for a single building. Where the buildings contain different occupancy groups or are of different types of construction, the area shall be that allowed for the most restrictive occupancy or construction.
Where an S-2 parking garage of Construction Type I or IIA is erected on the same lot as a Group R-2 building, and there is no fire separation distance between these buildings, then the adjoining exterior walls between the buildings are permitted to have occupant use openings in accordance with Section 706.8. However, opening protectives in such openings shall only be required in the exterior wall of the S-2 parking garage, not in the exterior wall openings in the R-2 building, and these opening protectives in the exterior wall of the S-2 parking garage shall be not less than 11/2-hour fire protection rating.

722.2.1.4.3 Nonsymmetrical Assemblies
For a wall without finish on one side or having different types or thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation procedures of Sections 722.2.1.4.1 and 722.2.1.4.2 shall be performed twice, assuming either side of the wall to be the fire-exposed side. The fire-resistance rating of the wall shall not exceed the lower of the two values.
Exception: For an exterior wall with a fire separation distance greater than 5 feet (1524 mm) the fire shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only.
722.2.1.4.4 Minimum Concrete Fire-Resistance Rating
Where finishes applied to one or both sides of a concrete wall contribute to the fire-resistance rating, the concrete alone shall provide not less than one-half of the total required fire-resistance rating. Additionally, the contribution to the fire resistance of the finish on the nonfire-exposed side of a load-bearing wall shall not exceed one-half the contribution of the concrete alone.

722.7.2.1 Interior Surfaces
Layers of Type X gypsum board serving as noncombustible protection for interior surfaces of wall and ceiling assemblies determined in accordance with Table 722.7.1(1) shall be installed in accordance with the following:
Each layer shall be attached with Type S drywall screws of sufficient length to penetrate the mass timber at least 1 inch (25 mm) when driven flush with the paper surface of the gypsum board.
Exception: The third layer, where determined necessary by Section 722.7, shall be permitted to be attached with 1-inch (25 mm) No. 6 Type S drywall screws to furring channels in accordance with AISI S220.
Screws for attaching the base layer shall be 12 inches (305 mm) on center in both directions.
Screws for each layer after the base layer shall be 12 inches (305 mm) on center in both directions and offset from the screws of the previous layers by 4 inches (102 mm) in both directions.
All panel edges of any layer shall be offset 18 inches (457 mm) from those of the previous layer.
All panel edges shall be attached with screws sized and offset as in Items 1 through 4 and placed at least 1 inch (25 mm) but not more than 2 inches (51 mm) from the panel edge.
All panels installed at wall-to-ceiling intersections shall be installed such that ceiling panels are installed first and the wall panels are installed after the ceiling panel has been installed and is fitted tight to the ceiling panel. Where multiple layers are required, each layer shall repeat this process.
All panels installed at a wall-to-wall intersection shall be installed such that the panels covering an exterior wall or a wall with a greater fire-resistance rating shall be installed first and the panels covering the other wall shall be fitted tight to the panel covering the first wall. Where multiple layers are required, each layer shall repeat this process.
Panel edges of the face layer shall be taped and finished with joint compound. Fastener heads shall be covered with joint compound.
Panel edges protecting mass timber elements adjacent to unprotected mass timber elements in accordance with Section 602.4.2.2 shall be covered with 11/4-inch (32 mm) metal corner bead and finished with joint compound.
